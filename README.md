# Simple Keyboard - for an university study
  
Forked from https://github.com/rkkr/simple-keyboard

Personal modifications are mainly be done in the **"keystroke"** package (rkr.simplekeyboard.inputmethod.keystroke)

Code on the  **"touch_service"** branch will never be implemented in the project, it's an attempt to extract sliding movement on screen when an user scroll or swipe on his/her phone (package: rkr.simplekeyboard.inputmethod.touchservice).
